		<h2>Connor's Top Five Candies:</h2>
		<div class="cards">
			
			<div class="card">
				<img src="images/Twix-Wrapper-Small-removebg-preview.png" alt="A twix bar">
				<h3>Twix:</h3>
				<p>Twix are my favorite candy. The cookie bar center combined with the carmel, all coated in chocolate is amazing.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<img src="images/Milky-Way-Bar-Split-removebg-preview.png" alt="A Milky Way bar">
				<h3>MilkyWay:</h3>
				<p>A MilkyWay bar is my second favorite. The nougat and carmel are a great combination, and the chocolate just enhances that.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<img src="images/small-2_13-removebg-preview.png" alt="A bag of Pixy Stix">
				<h3>Pixy Stix:</h3>
				<p>Pixy Stix are pure flavored sugar, and that's why they're good. The flavors are all great, but if the paper gets wet, it's likely to stick to the paper, putting them, at number three.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<img src="images/m_m_bulk-removebg-preview.png" alt="M and Ms">
				<h3>M&amp;M's:</h3>
				<p>M&amp;M's are great chocolate coated in a candy shell. The size of regular M&amp;M's is what brings them down this far on the list, but mini M&amp;M's keep them in the top five, resting at number four.</p>
			</div>
			
			<div class="card">
				<img src="images/3musk-removebg-preview.png" alt="A 3 muskateers bar">
				<h3>3 Musketeers:</h3>
				<p>3 Musketeers are nougat covered in chocolate. The candy is pretty good, but it is nothing special, placing it at number five in the list.</p>
